Connect 2 clouds with VPC peering

>> Security Groups operate at instance level while NACL operates at VPC/Subnet level 
>> Security Layers = Security Group (Instance level) > VPC (Virtual private Network in Cloud) > NACl (VPC/Subnet level)
>> VPC peering can be done VPCs of different accoung as well 
>> VPC peering is unidirectional 
>> Create 2 VPCs 
>> Left Pane > Peering Connections > Create Peering Connection 
>> Requester > 1st VPC 
>> Accepter > 2nd VPC
