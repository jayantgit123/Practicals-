Java Spring boot Application with Maven integration with CI configuration create a build 


>> Find Spring Boot Application Code here - https://github.com/DevSecOpsG/Pet-application-ci-maven 
>> Download Maven for Windows > Unzip it > Add PATH variable of Mavan to System > E:\DevOps\Practical15\Maven\Binary\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin
>> Clone the above Code in Folder of local machine > cmd to the code location > #mvn -version# > #mvn package#
>> .jar file will be created and location is indicated on cmd screen 
>> cd to .jar file location > #java -jar <.jar file name>.jar --server.port=<Port> (Any Port)
